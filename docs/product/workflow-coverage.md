> **2026-10-22 clarification:** This 70-row matrix is historical first-pass accommodation, **not a final implementable contract**. See [all 73 feature decisions, gaps and gates](feature-audit.md) for W01–W70 and F071–F073 and [technical behavior/side-effect contracts](../architecture/behavior-contracts.md). Its legacy screen entry names are not current Glimpse UI labels. “P0–P1” here is historical rough planning; use current M1–M4 ordering. None of these rows is evidence that Android support exists yet.

# Waltz — 70 workflow accommodation matrix

Each human-voiced requirement has an explicitly named engineering primitive and an approachable first place to find it. Tiers are design priorities, not functionality already built. Conditional platform features must be shown honestly, not faked. Reference: 70-HUMAN-WORKFLOWS.md.

## Validation agreement

- P0 demands A001–A015: native photo selection with supported Google Photos cloud media, verified offline copies, durable shuffle and honest five-minute active-use rotation.
- For every row, create a deterministic fixture containing source assets, observed device state, rule priority, eligible images, expected destination updates, user feedback, and offline/Doze/failure result.
- The underlying collection dependency graph is acyclic and checked on edit and restore. No wallpaper-change event may recursively trigger itself without a cooldown and explicit permission.
- All requested Android permissions and external image rights are platform-/provider-gated; when unsupported, explain the limitation and propose the nearest safe alternative.
- Usability protocol: first-time users must never enter the advanced Rule Studio for W01. Tests for TalkBack, extreme font scale, keyboard, reduced motion and one-tap diagnostics apply across tiers.
