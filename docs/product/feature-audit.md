# Glimpse: feature-by-feature specification completeness audit

**Date:** 2026-10-22 · **Status:** normative pre-build contract and risk ledger; **no implementation exists**. Companion to [current decisions](../planning/current-decisions.md), [technical contracts](../architecture/behavior-contracts.md), [reel critique](../design/reel-ux-audit.md), [70 human workflows](workflows.md) and [screenshot/share features](image-import-sharing.md).

## Method, forwards and backwards

**Forward:** user scenario ID → intent and expected feedback → proposed native architecture → state transitions and fallbacks → screen entry → implementability/acceptance. **Backward:** screen/reel action → domain command → persistent record → Android/app effect → original user scenario. Any orphan is a requirement gap (no interface), invention (no user intent), or unacknowledged platform gamble.

Every feature needs: preconditions and permissions; user-facing entry; typed affected state; whether it changes the real wallpaper; failure/offline behavior; persistence/undo or backup; accessibility alternative; minimal verification. This register states what is reasonably clear **now** and flags research-dependent paths rather than making impossible promises.

**Tier labels**: M1 core first usable app; M2 personal daily driver; M3 expert/provider functions; M4 optional live/advanced experiments. They are *ordering only*, not completed work. **Gate labels:** `D` implementation spec sufficiently defined for first prototype, `R` remaining interaction/technical research, `P` OS/provider permission or feasibility gate, `A` visual accessibility/design approval. None signifies running code.

## Gap and risk classification

### Critical (P0) gaps exposed by reversing the trace

1. **Naming/authority:** current PRODUCT-SPECIFICATION and NATIVE-ANDROID-ARCHITECTURE still have user-visible **Waltz, Today, Rhythms, Scenes, Rules, Next** while Glimpse uses **Home, Collections, Discover, Automation, Next photo/Change now**. Do not bulk replace domain terms: Scene and Rule remain valid **internal concepts**. Use [current decisions](../planning/current-decisions.md) and an explicit glossary.
2. **First-action state:** one “Next” button cannot cover browse-next, rotate-now, queue-next and simulator-next. Commands and copy must be distinct. See [typed state contract](../architecture/behavior-contracts.md).
3. **Reel scope:** previous designs specified a reel *image browser* but not a selector for collections, destinations or visually previewable variants. [Critical reel audit](../design/reel-ux-audit.md) now offers candidate types with strong rejects for arbitrary settings.
4. **Native schedule limitation:** WorkManager cannot promise a periodic five-minute wake; background wake/lock/geofence/precise 8pm claims are gated proposals. Sideload status does not relax Android battery rules. Confirm actual hardware/API behavior before advertising automatic results.
5. **Google Photos auto-sync:** Photo Picker provides user-selected media, not ongoing whole-album sync. W08 must remain explicit stretch feasibility, not a standard supported adapter.
6. **System-wide dynamic palette:** W29 requests changing OS extracted Material You colours. Glimpse can control its own theme and image content; arbitrary global wallpaper-derived colours may not be exposed to third-party apps. Label unsupported until verified.
7. **External display / multi-profile**: W27 and W69 cannot promise cross-display/system-user wallpaper mutation; Android capabilities and user boundaries first.
8. **Actual visual references:** v4 screenshots omit many required actions and edge states. They are art, not exhaustive UI specs. Bind reference regions + machine screen contract before implementing.
9. **Permission/rights:** remote sources, weather and location need explicit legal/capability gate and visible absence states. Metadata licensing claims must not become fabricated rights certification.
10. **Asset publication:** new tactile binary PNG is in GitHub, but the full deck source ZIP and PDFs may still need publication; verify current tree and hashes rather than repeat stale “nothing uploaded” claims.

### Design-open (P1) decisions to evaluate, not dictate

- Single large photo reel versus asymmetric **Collection → Photo** dual reels on larger screens; compact portrait fallback collection picker.
- Optional **Home/Lock** pair visual editor, with independent application actions and capability gating.
- Recent-history or crop-variant reel, only when it improves preview/recovery relative to list/cards.
- Rule entry/scene configuration naming; whether Automation needs distinct Presets/Rules/Activity subsections and contextual cross-links.

### Tech-open (P1/P2) proof spikes

- Physical 5-minute active-use scheduler and how status is exposed across battery modes.
- WallpaperManager result reconciliation when a wallpaper is changed *outside* Glimpse: API visibility is limited on newer Android; report “unknown/last confirmed” rather than falsely knowing current home/lock image.
- Device-specific Home/Lock separation, launcher scrolling, external display, foldables.
- Photo Picker URI and cloud-stream behavior, including offline verification.
- Real component frame-time and overlay/clip GPU performance for one or two large paper reels.

## Pre-build acceptance rule

Feature rows are **specified hypotheses**, not declared platform implementations. Before shipping any row, its owning PR must link a real device/API capability record (if gated), data transition test, accessibility alternative and visible no-success/failure state. M3/M4 rows do not block the M1 personal APK.
