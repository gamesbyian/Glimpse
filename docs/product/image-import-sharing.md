# Waltz: Screenshot Quick Capture and Google Lens Handoff

Status: approved product requirements, partly implemented. Updated 27 October 2026. These additions extend the quick-start contract, not the advanced rule grammar.

**Implementation evidence (27 October):** Native Android image-sharing ingress, explicit collection confirmation, SHA-verified immutable snapshot and source-restart survival are merged in [#53](https://github.com/gamesbyian/Glimpse/pull/53). This is the *unchanged-original intake step only*. Crop, rotate, straighten, reversible edit recipes, and quick Use Now/Add Next remain distinct incomplete features; the explicit, foreground-only Android clipboard image paste route is merged in [#56](https://github.com/gamesbyian/Glimpse/pull/56), with dedicated real-emulator clipboard evidence, but still needs physical/OEM acceptance. Do not mark the F071 end-to-end editor workflow complete or claim physical screenshot-toolbar acceptance.

## Requirement F071: Screenshot to collection in seconds

**Human need:** "I just captured a screenshot, and I want to paste it into Waltz, straighten or rotate it, crop out the irrelevant bits, save it with my rainbow wallpapers, and decide whether it's the wallpaper I see right now or simply joins the rotation."

### Entry routes (equivalent results)
1. Android screenshot toolbar -> Share -> Waltz, by exported ACTION_SEND image/* receiver; accept ACTION_SEND_MULTIPLE as optional batch intake.
2. Waltz -> prominent **Add** -> **Paste image**, reading a user-initiated image MIME ClipData URI from ClipboardManager; if unsupported/expired clipboard, explain and offer Photo Picker or Share.
3. Waltz -> **Add** -> Photos / Files with system Photo Picker or SAF.
4. Optional pinned launcher shortcut or Quick Settings tile opens the user-driven quick-import sheet, but never captures the screen itself.

No background clipboard polling, accessibility-service screen interception, MediaProjection acquisition, blanket photo-library permission, or invisible surveillance. Android screenshot interfaces vary across OEMs; sharing is the portable primary route. A screenshot may be saved in the gallery yet *not* available through clipboard; show the picker fallback prominently.

### Proposed 3-stage quick sheet
**1. Edit**: full-screen edge-to-edge immersive image, pinch/drag to pan and zoom; prominent 90-degree clockwise/counterclockwise rotation, fine straightening (-45 to +45 degrees), Reset, Undo/Redo, screen ratio guide with home/lock safe areas, free crop, portrait preset, pixel-resolution feedback. Keep EXIF orientation correct. Avoid destruction: store original and edit recipe separately; save render for wallpaper.
**2. Place**: target collection (last used preselected, searchable, create new inline); duplicate detected? add membership without copying redundant original unless user chooses a distinct edited variant. Provide explanatory storage-size estimate for large imports.
**3. Finish**: three mutually exclusive options:
- **Use Now**: save in collection, immediately apply on chosen destination(s), pin as the current item in active rotation, then resume normal schedule from now by default; optional “hold this wallpaper” period.
- **Add Next**: save then queue as the next eligible rotation item without altering currently shown wallpaper.
- **Just Save**: save to collection, respect existing shuffle/rotation queue and do not apply now.
Destination choice Home / Lock / Both appears if supported. Defaults remember last selection but never silently change both destinations. Completion confirms photo saved, current wallpaper status, next eligible change, and Undo.

### State and integrity semantics
- Single transactional content-import boundary: stage bytes from granted URI into private temp storage; verify MIME, pixel bounds, actual decode and size; hash for duplicate detection; persist immutable source plus crop/rotation recipe; commit collection membership in Room; atomically publish staged bytes; reconcile crash interruptions.
- Clipboard URI permissions can be temporary: persist a local copy before editing. Never store ephemeral provider URIs as the sole long-term image.
- Apply wallpaper and DB mutation are not one atomic operation across Android APIs: record intent, attempt application, record real result, expose retry and diagnostics; failed wallpaper apply must not lose imported image.
- Re-edit original, view history, restore crop, remove from lineup without deleting source. Explicitly distinguish “collection membership” vs “current wallpaper” vs “next queue position”.
- Support PNG, JPEG, WebP and supported HEIF/AVIF via Android decoders; cautiously reject unexpected file content, giant dimensions, animated/multiframe ambiguities; scale previews without full-resolution OOM.
- Content remains on-device. Deletion of imported original must be explicit and independently confirmed.

### UX/accessibility
- User can reach **Share to Waltz -> Rotate -> Crop -> Use Now** in approximately five actions with default collection and destination.
- Rotation has labelled controls, not gesture-only operation. Screen-reader crop alternative uses accessible four-edge sliders and numeric angle input. Every action has announced results.
- Preserve touch target >=48dp; larger text, magnification and landscape orientation; image preview offers contrast outline and safe-area labels, never relies on colour alone.
- Pending “Use Now” shows actual apply result, not an optimistic success toast.

## Requirement F072: Search any image with Google Lens

**Human need:** "I see a photo in my wallpaper collection and wonder what that building, plant or object is. I want to send it to Google Lens right there without exporting it manually or changing my wallpaper."

### Product surfaces
- Image detail -> overflow **Search with Google Lens** with familiar search icon and “Sends a copy to Google” disclosure the first time.
- Long-press grid item -> Search with Lens (where available); current wallpaper activity card -> same operation; batch selection excludes Lens because Lens is inherently image-at-a-time.
- Choose **Original image** (default) or **Wallpaper crop** from a non-blocking sub-choice, remembering last preference. The image is not added to an app-specific shared cloud.

### Android implementation
- Google does not supply Waltz a guaranteed stable, general-purpose public Lens image-submission API. Do not hardcode undocumented private actions or component names, scrape Google Photos, or claim the target is installed.
- First prefer a validated public share/intent handler when actual device package resolution shows a capable Lens destination. Otherwise use Android Sharesheet ACTION_SEND with image/* and EXTRA_STREAM content URI, temporary URI permission grants (FileProvider), appropriate ClipData, and explicit read-grant flag.
- Handle ActivityNotFoundException, no handler, cancellation, target failures and revoked image data. Offer **Share image** or “Open in Google Photos and use Lens” guidance where relevant, without guaranteeing Lens itself can consume the payload.
- Since Lens is an outside Google feature, it may require internet and shares the image with Google's services per their terms; no data goes to a Waltz backend.
- Selecting Lens must not modify source image, current wallpaper, rotation queue, collection membership or user settings.

### Contract tests
S071-01 Share fresh screenshot via Android Sharesheet -> Waltz editor preloaded; no broad media permission.
S071-02 Clipboard image URI -> paste success; clipboard text/expired URI -> comprehensible Photo Picker fallback.
S071-03 Rotate 90 degrees and crop; reopened original remains lossless and user can revise recipe.
S071-04 Use Now with active no-repeat shuffle -> current selection changes, future queue stays coherent, timer restarts as labelled.
S071-05 Add Next -> next eligible item; Just Save -> no immediate wallpaper change.
S071-06 Process killed during import or apply -> recovery without orphaned DB rows/files, item remains retriable.
S071-07 10k-pixel screenshot, malformed MIME, duplicate screenshot, out-of-disk and revoked grants -> no crash, clear recovery.
S071-08 TalkBack, 200% text scaling, keyboard/switch controls and landscape all complete edit and apply flow.
S072-01 Any cached user image -> choice original/crop -> external share/compatible Lens, unmodified app state.
S072-02 Lens unavailable -> user-visible Sharesheet fallback, never dead button or undocumented direct intent.
S072-03 URI access to recipient scoped and temporary; recipient can decode full image; no external activity leaks private paths.
S072-04 Cancel and return -> Waltz returns to same image/scroll location with edit state intact.

### Roadmap and priority
F071 screenshot share/import/edit = P0 (first release); editor non-destructive rotation/crop and Use Now semantics P0. Clipboard paste P1 due to provider differences; never postpone screenshot **Share** intake. F072 Lens via general sharing = P1; dedicated Lens label contingent on verified supported target. Native per-image Share = P0. Add compatibility tests on Pixel and representative Samsung/OEM builds.

## Requirement F073: Universal outbound image sharing and editing (supersedes Lens-only action design)

**Human need:** “If I find something in my collection, I want to send it to a friend in a chat, drop it into ChatGPT, attach it to an email, save a copy to Google Drive, search it with Google Lens or Google Images, or open it in my favourite editor, without hunting down the original file.”

**Primary interaction**: Image detail -> prominent **Share** action (also current wallpaper, collection multi-select, and full-screen viewer). Android Sharesheet is the default, not Waltz's own hardcoded destination grid. OS-provided direct-share targets, app suggestions, device-to-device channels and installed apps remain available as Android exposes them. An optional **Edit in…** action uses the standard compatible-handler flow rather than presuming an editor API. Dedicated shortcuts for frequent targets are optional conveniences that must degrade to standard Share when unsupported.

### Output chooser and semantics
- Default **Original** (best quality, intact pixels); option **Wallpaper version** (crop, rotation, colour edits baked into exported image); optionally **Current rendered wallpaper** where legally and technically available, explicitly distinguished from source and user edits.
- Choice is remembered per action *only* with clear reversible preference; always indicate what will be shared. Do not accidentally send a full screenshot with private notification/status bar content if the user thought they were sending a crop: show a preview and clear Original/Crop label before dispatch.
- For common one-tap Share, start Android Sharesheet after preparing a safe temporary URI. For advanced formats/quality or multiple-image batch, show a lightweight preparatory sheet; keep one-image sharing fast.
- Multi-select -> **Share N images** using ACTION_SEND_MULTIPLE with ClipData and streams. Count and total estimated payload shown; warn about receiver limits; chunk or request fewer images rather than silently dropping items.

### Platform contracts
- ACTION_SEND for one file, ACTION_SEND_MULTIPLE for batches with MIME image/png, image/jpeg or image/* as appropriate; content:// URI from FileProvider or hardened app-owned ContentProvider; FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION plus appropriate ClipData. Never expose file:// paths, database identifiers, internal folder structure or unnecessary metadata.
- ACTION_CHOOSER via Intent.createChooser; chooser/app package visibility is intentionally limited on modern Android. Avoid QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES, accessibility overlays, hidden target components and screen-scraping.
- **Google Drive**: display as Android Sharesheet target if installed and capable; alternatively use SAF ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT as platform-native **Save copy to…** for arbitrary document providers, including a supported Drive document provider. Never claim direct account synchronization.
- **Chat, email, ChatGPT**: participate as compatible installed Android share targets when they advertise image receiving. Waltz cannot guarantee any particular application or chat supports an image-share intent on a given version; never fabricate such integrations.
- **Editing apps**: use ACTION_SEND and/or ACTION_EDIT where handler capabilities support them; share a copied original or flattened wallpaper version. Most third-party editors will not return an edit or overwrite Waltz's image. Offer explicit **Import edited result** (Share back to Waltz or picker) and link the result as a new variant instead of promising round-trip persistence.
- **Google Lens / Google Images**: use supported external share/chooser flows where a capable handler is available. There is no assumed stable public Lens or reverse Google Images upload API; browser fallback to Google Images does not automatically upload the image. Explain this limitation without advertising an impossible one-tap guarantee.
- **Link sharing**: Waltz hosts no images, therefore **Copy link** is available only for a valid externally sourced image URL, never generated for a local-only asset.
- **Metadata/privacy**: optional “Remove location and camera metadata” defaults on for sharing edited/cached renderings; original-file sharing warns if sensitive EXIF is present and allows a sanitized export. Do not promise EXIF removal from the untouched raw original. All external sharing requires a user gesture, no background egress.
- **Reliability**: staged sharing URI stays valid long enough for slow receivers, including when Waltz backgrounds; TTL-based cleanup occurs after safe grace period rather than immediately in onActivityResult. The share receiver must be able to read content in a separate process. Catch failures without losing image/scroll state. Scoped grants, content security tests, and cache quotas required.

### UX placements
- Image detail primary **Share**; secondary **Open in editor**, **Search with Lens** (capability-aware), **Save copy to…**.
- Collection grid long-press selection: batch Share; current-wallpaper card: Share / Edit / Explore image.
- Every outbound action leaves collection membership, rotation order, current wallpaper, history and crop recipe unchanged; round-trip editing must explicitly create a new version.

### Acceptance tests
S073-01 Share local screenshot to at least two installed independent handlers; decoder receives valid URI, no broad storage permission.
S073-02 Share both unedited original and transformed wallpaper crop, verify actual pixel difference and preview label.
S073-03 Share to a capable mail app (attachment), messaging app and compatible ChatGPT app when installed; gracefully fallback to chooser when target unavailable.
S073-04 Save copy using ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT to local and Drive-capable SAF providers if installed.
S073-05 Edit in an external editor, return to Waltz and import edited result as a new linked variant; no overwrite of original.
S073-06 Share 1, 10 and 100 items; receiver size/URI limits reported; image count correct; no clipboard/file path leak.
S073-07 Source with EXIF GPS data: offer sanitized copy; validate exported file has no GPS tags.
S073-08 App/background process killed after chooser launches: recipient retains read access during transfer; cleanup eventually reclaims staging files.
S073-09 TalkBack, large text and keyboard navigation can reach Share, choose original/crop, and safely cancel.
S073-10 Missing Lens/ChatGPT/Drive handlers, denied recipient access, revoked source and malformed image produce truthful recovery without modifying wallpaper state.

### Scope and roadmap
P0: generic per-image share, original/crop, all Android-compatible destinations, cache/grant safety, batch-share basics, SAF save copy.
P1: dedicated actions and capability-aware Lens/edit shortcuts, returned-edit variant associations, configurable metadata scrubbing and smarter batch-limit handling.
This requirement is an explicit extension of F072: “Search with Lens” is a contextual specialization of generic Share, never the sole means to export an image.
