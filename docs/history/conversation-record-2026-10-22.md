# Glimpse (formerly Waltz): conversation record and production diary

**Recorded:** 2026-10-22. **Destination on publication:** `Glimpse/production-diary/` in `gamesbyian/general-purpose`. **Scope:** naming, paper-reel design, layout comparisons, native motion, human-centred UX and GitHub publication, through the 2026-10-22 rename request.

## Transcript completeness and provenance

This file preserves **user-message wording as supplied in the available conversation context** (with possible whitespace/Markdown formatting normalization) and a chronological, **explicitly nonverbatim** account of the assistant replies and repository outcomes. It is **not a full raw ChatGPT transcript**: this session's tools cannot export the complete conversation message stream, and some earlier assistant turns and uploaded-artifact exchanges are represented only by prior-conversation summaries. Missing messages, private reasoning, unviewable UI and timestamps have **not** been invented. When a first-party ChatGPT data export becomes available, replace or supplement this record with that actual export; do not retroactively label this one complete.

We deliberately retain the distinction between user wording, assistant summary, a finished artifact, and a GitHub-verified blob. This record is more useful than a fabricated verbatim transcript and should never be used as proof of a user's approval of an unapproved prototype.

## Part I. Naming and visual direction

### User, previous context retained (verbatim excerpts)

> I'd like 25 proposals for new project names, please. Single words. Existing words, not coinages. Things that suggest constant change or shifting appearance. Nothing that's already a famous app name.

> I hate them. None of them feel effortless or poetic

> I like Ebb. Give me some that evoke the pleasure of looking up and finding something unexpected

**Assistant response, nonverbatim summary:** After an overly technical naming set, proposed gentler familiar words including Ebb and Glimpse. User's preference settled on Glimpse for a wallpaper manager earlier referred to as Waltz. Exact complete exchange is not available in this retrieval.

### User

> Yep, I like Glimpse.
>
> How would you update the visual design and UI text?

**Assistant response, nonverbatim summary:** Proposed photographic, warm, quieter visual identity; screen and icon directions; navigation Home / Discover / Collections / Automation; user-visible ordinary terms such as Next photo, Set as wallpaper, Share; current image hero dominant; thoughtful differentiation between poetic empty-state copy and functional clarity. Proposed colors paper/teal/coral/sunlight/sage. Some illustrative image queries and inline diagrams were used in the chat but are not reproduced here.

### User

> I have an idea for the icon that I think could be expanded conceptually throughout the app... A viewmaster disk.

**Assistant response, nonverbatim summary:** Adopted original paper reel motif with distinct photo windows: iconic small launcher silhouette, collection covers, and larger selector with notch movement. Reels represent sequences rather than fictitious finite counts. Avoid literal commercial View-Master trade dress and do not replace ordinary actions with unexplained mechanical metaphors.

### User

> Go to it, give me a pdf to look at

**Assistant response, nonverbatim summary:** Produced a 16-page paper-reel identity exploration PDF with icon choices, collection covers and mock interface usage. As with other generated binaries, publication status must be verified separately.

### User

> I most like the paper reel, but I feel like all the reels need larger image windows, they aren't bound by the actual requirements of the viewmaster technology

**Assistant response, nonverbatim summary:** Selected tactile paper direction and materially increased window sizes; user preference drives conceptual geometry rather than fidelity to vintage stereoscopy.

### User

> Beautiful! Make sure any recently created new files are saved to the repo please
>
> So, if we use the paper reel idea within the app, presumably a portion of the reel will be off-screen to cover the illusion of a potentially infinite reel. I'd like you to consider how that can be integrated to a cohesive app ui and UX and revise your pitch deck appropriately

**Assistant response, nonverbatim summary:** Developed oversized partially clipped reel, stable hero preview, finite virtualized slots, accessible grid escape; reworked pitch deck into 57-slide Glimpse v4 and a 16-page focused section. Published initial original SVG and detailed paper-reel UX specification. Binary transfer to GitHub was initially blocked; a durable Library archive was created. A tactile board PNG was subsequently independently verified to be a real GitHub blob, correcting the earlier overbroad blocked-publication claim.

## Part II. Learning and motion

### User

> What lessons would you want to take from the ring road and wallgen repos, as well as online resources and precedents, regarding ai-driven ui/ux design and implementation and matching visual references?

**Assistant response, nonverbatim summary:** Inspected real Ring Road and wallgen repositories. Lessons: reference/source provenance; compare actual runtime screenshot against immutable approved art, region by region; distinguish required/conditional/forbidden controls; human signoff independent from pixel-diff results; hardware device capture matters because browser screenshots can pass while painted layers flicker or disappear on a phone; CI should be proportional. Proposed reference image contract and runtime/semantic/human acceptance gates.

### User

> What rendering approach will you use to ensure gloriously smooth & deliberate movement and animation baked in from square one?

**Assistant response, nonverbatim summary:** Chose native Kotlin/Compose, custom HWUI-accelerated Canvas/drawWithCache/graphicsLayer paper reel, bounded adjacent photo textures, caching, an interruptible velocity/spring animation controller and stable image identity independent of angular display state. No blanket 120 Hz performance claim before Pixel 6 Pro benchmarks. Motion starts at first native prototype, not at the last design-polish milestone. Wrote `GLIMPSE-MOTION-RENDERING-ARCHITECTURE.md`.

### User

> Hey, check this out
>
> https://github.com/gamesbyian/general-purpose/issues/29?utm_source=chatgpt.com

**Assistant response, nonverbatim summary:** Read the ROYGBIV-to-Glimpse handoff issue and source materials from wallgen PR #446. Imported method rather than another project's control taxonomy: human goals, expected outcome before acting, actual software causality and navigation. Wrote `GLIMPSE-HUMAN-EXPECTATIONS-WALKTHROUGHS.md` and linked it from motion and UX authorities; responded to issue #29. No claim of actual user study results.

## Part III. Specification audit and asset recovery

### User

> What changes to the specs and plans are called for now? What new files need to be moved into the repo? Go ahead as best without moving into any actual app building

**Assistant response, nonverbatim summary:** Audited Glimpse/Waltz written contracts and old naming conflicts. Added a current-decisions page, machine-readable screen contract, visual acceptance plan and asset publication plan. Established separate user-visible states for selected photo, queued photo, applied/acknowledged wallpaper, eligible change and share variant. No app code.

### User

> Go ahead and resolve!

**Assistant response, nonverbatim summary:** Preserved six major v4 design binaries in persistent ChatGPT Library at `/Glimpse/`: v4 editable source archive, PPTX, full PDF, design-section PDF, identity exploration PDF and tactile board. Updated GitHub publication issue #28; did not misrepresent Library files as GitHub blobs.

### User

> Try the upload again please

**Assistant response, nonverbatim summary:** Retried; reported binary transport still constrained. Later work found working GitHub base64 Git blob creation and demonstrated real binary publication, so the earlier permanent-sounding limitation is superseded.

### User

> Your connection should be capable, it has been in the past

**Assistant response, nonverbatim summary:** Reexamined GitHub connector and file-bridge routes. Eventually used `create_blob(encoding=base64)` + `create_tree` + `create_commit` + `update_ref` successfully for binary fixture publication and artifacts. This proved binary GitHub publication was possible for at least some files.

### User

> 2 things next.
>
> A top-to-bottom, backwards and forwards audit of the spec. Every feature needs to be specified, every technical approach and implemention principle needs to be specified wherever reasonable.
>
> A critical and suspicious audit of the proposed visual layouts, controls and UI/UX specifics for completeness, sanity and motivation. We want the reels, but we want to make sure they function in a way that makes them meaningful. The user uses the reel to move between and select images or categories or modes, maybe even options and settings, so the placement and function of the reel mechanisms must be motivated by legimately fundamental functions of the app and experiences of the user. We should make sure we're not overlooking opportunities to have more than reel, arrayed and balanced with attractive asymmetry, on various screen when various tasks call for multiple selections that suit the reel concept.

**Assistant response, nonverbatim summary:** Audited all 70 W-scenarios plus F071–F073, 24 distinct UI surfaces, command/state side effects and Android feasibility; wrote technical behavior contract, exhaustive feature register, critical reel UX audit, UI census and work queue. Reels were authorized only for genuine typed finite selections. Strong two-reel hypotheses: Collection → Photo and independently previewed Home/Lock on wide layouts. Rejected time/settings/permissions/rule-priority reels; preserved conventional grid and accessibility. Reconciled old product/Android docs with current Glimpse authority.

## Part IV. Controlled layout study, recovery and rename

### User

> Get to it!

**Assistant response, nonverbatim summary:** Generated six apples-to-apples design variants with the same six source photographs and three named collections, phone canvas 420×900 design units and a wider 960×540 illustration. Variants: A single Photo reel; B asymmetric Collection → Photo; B compact picker fallback; C Home/Lock compact preview; C0 compact destination tabs baseline; D wide paired Home/Lock reels. Produced the eight-page visual comparison PDF, original editable SVGs, fixed JPEG fixtures, reproducible Python generator, JSON manifest and decision record. Recommended A as compact baseline, B as experiment, tabs as compact destination baseline, D as wide-device experiment. No Android UI or measured usability was claimed.

**Repository evidence at time of rename request:** the six editable SVGs, `design/reel-comparison/fixtures/source/art1.jpg` to `art6.jpg`, `build_comparison.py`, `COMPARISON-MANIFEST.json`, `GLIMPSE-REEL-LAYOUT-COMPARISON-2026-10-22.md`, the 946,437-byte compact review PDF and 475,384-byte reproducible source ZIP were **verified as real GitHub files** in `Waltz/`.

### User

> Session stalled, it probably couldn't contain your awesomness! Please carefully recover your work and thinking, then keep on as you think best.
>
> When you're done, please save a full transcript of this conversation to the waltz directory and change the name of the directory from waltz to Glimpse

**Assistant response, current handoff summary, not verbatim:** Recover verified artifacts first; preserve the best-available session record without inventing missing turns; then perform a Git tree move from `Waltz/` to `Glimpse/`, retaining all Git blob SHA identities, updating path references, and verifying the final tree. No app building or CI disruption.

## Remaining archival gap

A **complete raw verbatim transcript** of this ChatGPT conversation is **not exposed by the available connected tools**, and some earlier assistant/tool content is therefore represented here by marked summaries. This is not a substitute for the first-party message export. If that export is obtained later, archive it in the same `production-diary/` directory, alongside this readable, source-linked development record. Do not fill unknown passages with reconstructed quotes.
